## Introduction

Unit testing is a crucial aspect of software development that ensures the reliability and correctness of your code. In this repository, you will learn how to write unit tests for your Golang code without the need for external testing packages.

## Getting Started

To get started with unit testing in Golang, clone this repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/tamathecxder/golang-unit-test.git
```
You will find a collection of code examples and test files to practice with in this repository.

## Writing Unit Tests

In the "tests" directory, you will find examples of Go code and corresponding unit tests. Study these examples to understand how to structure and write unit tests for your Golang functions.

## Running Unit Tests

You can run unit tests using the go test command followed by the directory or files containing your test functions. For example:

```shell
go test ./tests
```

This command will execute all tests in the specified directory.
